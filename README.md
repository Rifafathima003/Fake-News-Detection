Fake News Detection using Logistic Regression


This project focuses on detecting Fake News using Machine Learning techniques. The model is built on a Logistic Regression classifier with TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. 
A Streamlit Web App is deployed to allow users to test news articles and classify them as Real or Fake.
